Multivariate analysis and pathway enrichment
============================================
 
Overview
=====================

In this exercise we will use two different datasets, a RNAseq dataset and a MS proteomics dataset on the same clinical samples. The clinical samples are tumour tissue from lung cancer patients. The data files needed for the analyses can be found here:

The software we will use for multivariate analysis is SIMCA and for the pathway enrichment analysis Cytoscape.

The instructor (Lina Hultin Rosenberg) will go through the analysis during the introduction lecture, so the steps will not be further detailed here. You can also find the instructions in the workshop documents:

Multivariate analysis with SIMCA
===================================

SIMCA is already installed on the computers in the Mac computer hall. During this workshop we will focus on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as well as Orthogonal Partial Least Squares analysis (OPLS). Details on the methods as well as references for further reading can be found in the SIMCA help.


Pathway enrichment with Cytoscape
====================================

Cytoscape is installed on the computers, but each student needs to install two Cytoscape applications we will use: ClueGO and CluePedia.

Open Cytoscape and select Apps – App Manager – click ClueGO and install. 

A window will show up, click Relicense and copy and paste the following license key:

``!LnD-mf@O-H41&-Q7in-mH70-E9@2-8]k6-@5UW``

Install CluePedia under Apps – App Manager.

During this workshop we will look at enrichments of functional terms and pathways in the lists selected by the multivariate analysis in SIMCA.
Tutorials for the applications ClueGO and CluePedia can be found here:
