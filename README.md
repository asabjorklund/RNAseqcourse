RNAseqcourse
============

Code that is needed to generate the RNA seq course. The webpage is created by reStructuredText  
and you need to install the SPHINX (http://sphinx-doc.org/) package in order to build the webpages


To build the pages stand in the same folder as the makefile and type 

<code>
make html
</code>

Hoopefully this will generate the final output.
