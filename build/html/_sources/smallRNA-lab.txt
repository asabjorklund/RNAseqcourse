Small RNA computer excercise
============================


In this exercise we will analyze a few small RNA libraries, from Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) embryos and two cell lines (KC167 cells derived from whole embryos, and ML-DmD32 cells derived from adult wing discs). This is a subset of a much larger data set used to study microRNAs and other small RNAs in Drosophila:

* emb_0-1 0-1 hour embryos, SRR069840
* emb_6-10 6-10 hour embryos, SRR069839 
* kc167_r1, KC167 cells, SRR028728
* ml-DmD32_r1, ML-DmD32 cells replicate1, SRR069508
* ml-DmD32_r2, ML-DmD32 cells replicate2, SRR488696

(These data sets are described more in this paper: http://genome.cshlp.org/content/24/7/1236.full)

The aim of the exercise is to show a simple way to process small RNA data and to quantify the expression of microRNAs.
